If a method returns a collection, you often don't want the caller to be able to mess around with the resulting collection. <!-- more --> In the following code the caller is able to do that:

    private List<Thing> things;
    
    public List<Thing> getThings() {
        return things;
    }

To prevent this, you can make a copy of the list manually, but that is boring to implement and slow. What you'd actually want is a wrapper for the list, that passes calls like `get()` and `size()` to the original list object, and that blocks calls like `set()` and `add()`. Guess what: such a wrapper exists, as I discovered today. It is called [`Collections.unmodifiableList()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableList%28java.util.List%29).

So you can just do the following:

    private List<Thing> things;
    
    public List<Thing> getThings() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(things);
    }

There are some more methods like this, such as `unmodifiableMap()` and `unmodifiableSet()`.
