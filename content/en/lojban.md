Lojban
======

I am interested in constructed languages. Lojban is a constructed language that is parseable, which means that a computer is able to find out the grammatical structure of a sentence.

There are several parsers for Lojban, but they all give rather cryptic output. I made a front-end to the *camxes* parser that tries to make its output a bit clearer. This front-end is available [here](/lojban-parser).
