<p>Hi! My name is Willem Sonke.</p>

<%= render "/image.html", :url => "/static/img/willem.jpg", :description => "This is me!" %>

<p>I am currently pursuing a PhD at the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/aga">Applied Geometric Algorithms</a> group of the <a href="http://www.tue.nl">Eindhoven University of Technology</a> in The Netherlands.</p>

<p>I have several hobbies, including programming things for fun, making 3D animations, learning constructed languages and designing things.</p>

<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>This website is maintained using the static site generator <a href="http://nanoc.ws">Nanoc 4</a>. Contrary to most static site generators, Nanoc is really flexible &ndash; you can control exactly what happens when the site is generated. I think it is a great system.</p>
<p>The frontend is made using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org">Less</a>. The font used is <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/open-sans">Open Sans</a>.</p>
